                <h1>Plugin Function</h1>
                <p>This plugin is built to retrieve additional information about patient sets by allowing one to send context-specific information to Openi2b2Infobuttons about concepts related to each patient.</p>

                <h1>Choosing a Concept</h1>
                <p>Choosing a concept can be done in 1 of 2 ways:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Choose one of the default high level concepts.  This will result in all items related to that concepts being returned for each patient.  For example, choosing "Medications" will cause all medicaitons for each patient to be returned.</li>
                  <li>Select "Choose my own."  This will open a place to drop a custom concept for querying.  Note that it is better to choose lower level concepts in this case such as "Acute Rheumatic Fever" rather than "Circulatory system".</li>
                </ol>

                <h1>Finishing the Query with a Patient Set</h1>
                <p>In order to finish the query, simply drop a patient set into the appropriate location.  This will query information about the selected concept with respect to the patient set chosen.</p>

                <h1>Querying Openi2b2Infobuttons</h1>
                <p>Once the content from the query is returned, a link may be selected to query Openi2b2Infobuttons with the information.  The patient's demographic information (age and sex) along with the selected concept (a medication or a diagnosis) will be sent to Openi2b2Infobuttons for processing and a window filled with information about the chosen concept with respect to the patient demographic information will be returned.</p>
                <p>If a high-level concept is chosen from the radiobutton list, then the concepts associated with each patient will be shown below; however, if a concept is chosen, then the patients in the list will become hyperlinks that, when clicked, will send the selected concept and the patient demographic information to Openi2b2Infobuttons.</p>
